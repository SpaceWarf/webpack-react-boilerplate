## React Webpack Boilerplate

This is a project boilerplate to kick-start your app development. Included in this project is the basic setup for a React
app that uses Redux as a store manager, Sass as a style sheet language and Semantic as a UI framework, all bundled
with Webpack and Babel.

## Scripts

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
